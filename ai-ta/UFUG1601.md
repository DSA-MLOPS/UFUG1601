```bash
Fibonacci sequence: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
```


# Prime Detective!
Task: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves writing a Python program to investigate whether a given number is hiding something‚Äîa secret identity as a prime number!

Example Input:
```python
number = 7
```

Expected Output:
```bash
7 is a prime number
```

```bash
10 is not a prime number
```




# Maximum of Three Numbers
Write a Python program that takes three integer inputs from the user and determines the maximum of the three numbers. Print the maximum number like this:

```
i1 = 12
i2 = 7
i3 = 20
Maximum: 20
```

# Reverse Number
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer. The program should then reverse the digits of the entered number and print the reversed number like this:

```
user_input = 12345
Reversed number: 54321
```


# üåä Ride the Factorial Wave!
Task: The ocean's waves are inspiring, always coming in with force and receding, only to come back again. Write a Python program that mimics this persistence by calculating the factorial of a number. The twist? No direct methods! Dive in with a while loop instead.

Starter Code:
```python
user_input = 5  # Feel free to change this value
#Your code goes here
```

Expected Output:
```
Factorial: 120
```

# üé≠ Unmask the Duplicates!
Task: In the grand masquerade ball of data, some numbers are crashing the party by showing up more than once! Write a program to identify these uninvited duplicates in a list. Remember, even though duplicates are sneaky, they can't escape the keen eye of a for loop!

Starter Code:
```python
user_input = [4, 60, 4, 70, 60, 72]  # Mysterious numbers...
#Your detective code goes here

```
Expected Output:

```bash
Uninvited Guests: [4, 60]

```

# üõ∏ UFO Landing!
Task: UFOs are trying to communicate with us through patterns! They're sending a series of numbers, and we've noticed that they sometimes send the same number twice to signify a landing! Write a Python program that detects the first repeated number in a sequence, signaling a UFO landing spot.

```python
user_input = [2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 5]  # Alien transmission!
#Your code here

```

Expected Output:
```bash
First repeated number: 3
```

# üç© "Donut Forget the Discount!"

Task: A donut shop offers discounts every 'Nth' customer. Write a function that, when given a customer number, tells if they get a discount or not using a simple if-else statement. Psst, the 5th customer always gets a free donut!

Starter Code:
```python
def check_discount(customer_number):
    # Your tasty code here
    # print DISCONT or NO DISCOUNT

#Test your function with this input
print(check_discount(10))  # Customer number 10 is ready for a surprise!
```

üêç "Sssuper Ssseries!"
Task: Create a Python function named sss that takes a number 'n' and prints a series from 1 to 'n'. But here‚Äôs the catch: if the number is divisible by 5, it should print ‚ÄúSss‚Äù instead of the number. Utilize your knowledge of while loops and if-else conditions here.

Starter Code:
```python
def sss(n):
    # Your code here

#Test your function with this input
sss(15)
```

Expected Output:

```bash
1
2
3
4
Sss
6
7
8
9
Sss
11
12
13
14
Sss
```

# üîÑ "Recursive Mirror"

Task: Write a  function that takes a string and returns its mirror image. For example, "GPT" becomes "GPTTPG".

Starter Code:
```python
def mirror(s):
    # Your reflective code here

#Test your function with this input
print(mirror("Python"))  # Let's reflect on this!
```

Expected Output:
```bash
PythonnohtyP
```

# üìö "Bookworm"

Task: Write a function that takes a list of books and prints out all the books that start with the letter 'A'. Use a for loop to iterate through the list.

Starter Code:
```python
def bookworm(books):
    # Your code here

#Test your function with this input
books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "A Brief History of Time", "The Great Gatsby", "Atlas Shrugged"]
bookworm(books)
```

Expected Output:
```bash
A Brief History of Time
Atlas Shrugged
```

# üêå "The Patient Snail"
Task: A snail climbs up 7 cm each day and slips back 2 cm each night. If the snail is at the bottom of a 100cm well, how many days will it take to escape? Write a Python program using a while loop to find out!

Starter Code:
```python
well_height = 31
daily_climb = 7
nightly_slip = 2
days = 0

#Your while loop here
```

Expected Output:
```bash
Days: 6
```

# üí° "Function Junction"
Task: What's your function? Write a Python function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. It's simple but crucial; after all, even the most complex calculations need to add things up!

Starter Code:
```python
def add_two_numbers(number1, number2):
    # Your addition code here

#Test your function with this input
result = add_two_numbers(5, 17)
print(result)
```

Expected Output:
```bash
22
```
